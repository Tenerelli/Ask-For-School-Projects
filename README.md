# Ask-For-School-Projects
Due to my Masters Program guidelines, my projects/codes from class must be private. Please ask for access &amp; I will happily share them with you.

Within the private repository there are examples of SQL querying, Python data cleaning & machine learning, R cleaning & statistcal analysis, and data visualizations. I am happy to share those projects/codes upon request. 

Thank you & have a great day!
